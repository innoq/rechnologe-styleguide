description: Putting all of the components together

This category is really meant for the developers to play around with the components and try to put them together.
It is NOT the single point of truth.
It is supposed to serve as inspiration,
help correctly implement the view in the backend,
and test to make sure the components all behave responsively _without_ having to fire up a database.
