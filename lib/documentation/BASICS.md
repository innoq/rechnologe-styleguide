## Basic Styles

In every Frontend project there are some basic styles like colors, typography, breakpoints that are used by a lot of components. So it makes sens to give thos very important parts of the styling a place whre they can be all stored.
In our case you can find the `.scss` files in the `fundamentals` folder.

It is also helpful to have a written documentation for those files. That can be found in this chapter.
Please add a documentation file for each basic styling you are adding.
