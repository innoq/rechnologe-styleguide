title: Organism
description: Complex components

An organism is composed of molecules or organisms which are composed together.

## Is it a molecule or an organism?

This is actually a difficult question to answer.
When you start developing your component,
you may find that what you _thought_ was an molecule,
but after further development,
it turns out that the component is a lot more complex.

This styleguide does not bind the component implementation itself to a category.
If you find out later that your component is a molecule,
just adjust the aiur.config.js so that it is categorized with the other molecules.
