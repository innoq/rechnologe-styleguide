# rechnologe-styleguide

This is the style guide for the Rechnologe. It contains all UI components and documentation for how to use them.
The style guide is running on [aiur](]https://github.com/moonglum/aiur), a tool to generate style guides with a focus on pattern libraries. It is still work in progress and will be updated during the work on this style guide.

In this directory run:

```
npm i

Visit http://localhost:4001 to visit the pattern library.
